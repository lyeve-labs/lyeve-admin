# scripts/ comes with the manifests because package.json's `prepare` runs
# scripts/setup-hooks.mjs, and pnpm runs `prepare` on every install. Without the
# file the install exits 1 with "Cannot find module". The script itself is happy
# here: it exits 0 the moment it finds no git checkout, which is exactly what a
