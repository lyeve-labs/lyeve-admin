	/**
	 * Whether the database matches the schemas, and the control that makes it
	 * match.
	 *
	 * The foot of the sidebar is the furthest point on screen from anything that
	 * would make a reader look for it: a schema saved on the far right would
	 * leave a pending migration announced in the bottom left corner, below the
	 * fold on a short window, in a band the eye reads as chrome. It is a property of the instance, not of the navigation, so it
	 * belongs in the header beside the other instance-wide controls, and it has
	 * to survive the sidebar being put away.
	 *
	 * It reads nothing and writes nothing. The count and the queued statements
	 * arrive as props from the shell's own load, and applying is a form posted to
	 * the dashboard's action.
	 *
	 * The chip only opens the confirmation. The queue holds every tenant's
	 * pending drops on the tables they share, and a dropped column takes its
	 * data with it, so nothing runs until the reader has seen each statement.
	 * The form carries the descriptions it listed, and the action refuses the
	 * apply when the queue no longer matches them, so a drop queued after the
	 * list was read never runs unseen.
