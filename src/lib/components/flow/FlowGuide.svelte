		<p class="text-muted">
			A flow is a graph the tenant owns: one trigger, some nodes, the edges between them and a few
			settings. The trigger decides when it runs. Each node does one unit of work with the config
			you give it and hands its output down its edges. A flow is a draft until you publish it.
			Publishing writes a numbered version and mounts the trigger. Disable it to unmount the trigger
			without losing anything, and roll back to any earlier version from the settings panel.

			An edge carries the output of one node to an input port of the next. Every port has a name:
			<code class="font-mono text-xs">out</code> and <code class="font-mono text-xs">in</code> are the
			defaults, and a node such as Join names its ports
			<code class="font-mono text-xs">left</code> and <code class="font-mono text-xs">right</code>.
			A node runs once every inbound edge has resolved. A node with no inbound edge is a root and
			starts at once with the trigger payload as its input. The dashed line on the canvas shows
			that. Fan-out is allowed. A port that takes several edges receives them as a list in edge
			order. The graph is a DAG: the canvas refuses an edge that would close a cycle, and so does
			the engine.

			Any string in a node's config may carry

			<code class="font-mono text-xs">nodes.&lt;id&gt;</code> only for a node upstream of it, or the
			trigger. These names are available:

			Run test executes the draft on the canvas, not the published version, with the trigger JSON
			from the Test tab. A node with side effects (writes, HTTP calls other than GET, email, events)
			runs in dry-run mode and reports what it would have done instead of doing it. Switch on live
			side effects to let those nodes act. Until node stops the run after the node you name, so you
			can inspect an intermediate output. A test run is recorded like any other, marked as a test.
			Live runs come from the trigger, or from Run on a published flow.

			An export is the definition as JSON or YAML, positions included, so it re-imports as drawn.
			It never carries a secret. A datasource is referenced by name, and the importer resolves that
			name in the target tenant and lists the ones it could not find. Create them under Datasources
			before publishing. Secret variables export as the key alone, marked secret, with no value.
			Import creates a new flow, or replaces the draft of the flow whose slug you give.
