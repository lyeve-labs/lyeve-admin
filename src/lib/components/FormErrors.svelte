	 * time and is gone on the next click, so it leaves nothing in the document
	 * to read. An element that carries role="alert" but is not in the
	 * accessibility tree when the failure happens is announced inconsistently.
	 *
	 * The live region below is always mounted, so the text arriving inside it is
	 * a change to a region a screen reader is already watching. `contents` keeps
	 * the wrapper out of the surrounding flex or grid layout, so an empty region
	 * costs no gap.
