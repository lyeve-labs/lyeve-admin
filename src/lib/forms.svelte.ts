/**
 * The submit handler for a panel that closes itself, and whether it is running.
 *
 * A bare `use:enhance` applies the action result and resets the form, but never
 * touches the component state holding the panel open. The operator submits, the
 * fields clear, the panel stays put, and the new row is behind it: it reads as
 * "nothing happened", so they submit again. That is how a create panel produces
 * duplicate rows.
 *
 * The pending flag is the other half of the same problem. The panel stays
 * open for the whole round trip, so without it the primary sits live and
 * unchanged while the write is in flight, which reads as the same "nothing
 * happened". It lives here rather than in each page because a copy of
 * `let submitting = $state(false)` per page is a chance per page to forget one.
 *
 * Returned as an object rather than as a tuple so the two halves are named at
 * the call site:
 *
 *     const create = submitter(() => (open = false));
 *     <form use:enhance={create.enhance}>
 *     <Button loading={create.pending} type="submit">Create</Button>
 *
 * On failure the panel stays open so the error is visible against the values
 * that caused it.
 *
 * A form whose answer is computed from what it sent, such as a URL built from
 * a size and a format, passes `{ reset: false }`. Cleared, its fields no
 * longer say what the answer was built from.
