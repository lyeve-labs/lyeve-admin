/**
 * The settings hub: every settings page, grouped by what the reader came to
 * change, with a line saying what each one holds.
 *
 * The hub owns no content of its own. Anything it carried would be a second
 * copy of something another page owns, such as the content API and its tokens
 * on API access or the theme on Your account, so the hub only points.
 *
 * Which entries a reader sees is not decided here. An instance entry is shown
 * when the sidebar would show it, read from the tree `adminNav` built for the
 * reader's roles and this instance's plugins, so the hub and the sidebar
 * cannot disagree about who may open a page. Only the personal pages, which
 * have no sidebar row, are listed on their own terms: the account page always,
 * and each of the others while the plugin behind it runs.
