 * What a failed second factor tells the reader.
 *
 * `again` names the first step in the caller's words, such as "sign in
 * again", and finishes the sentences that send the reader back to it.
 *
 * Only a refusal of the code itself reads as a wrong code. The engine answers
 * 400 for a request it could not read and 422 for a code that did not match.
 *
 * A 401 with AUTH_MFA_NOT_CONFIGURED means the engine found no authenticator
 * app for the account: one that signs in with a passkey alone, or a store
 * that could not be read. Signing in again reaches the same challenge, so the
 * reader is told to ask an administrator. The sign-in page offers no passkey
 * sign-in to point to instead. Every other 401 is a challenge the engine no
 * longer honors (AUTH_CHALLENGE_EXPIRED: expired, malformed or already used)
 * or an account it no longer signs in (UNAUTHORIZED, AUTH_INVALID_CREDENTIALS:
 * disabled, expired or out of the tenant). No code passes either.
 *
 * A 429 is a locked account, or a challenge that has used up its attempts.
 * The engine sends the same code for both. The second can never pass, and the
 * first passes only after the lock lifts, so both go back to the first step
 * with a sentence that holds for either.
 *
 * Anything else, a 503 or an engine that never answered, did not check the
 * code, and calling it wrong would send the reader to their authenticator for
 * a code that was right.
