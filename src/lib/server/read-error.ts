 * What a detail page's load throws when its record could not be read.

 * A detail page has nothing to draw without its record, so a failed read ends
 * in the error page rather than in a notice. Only the engine's 404 says the
 * record does not exist. A role refusal, a refusal for the request rate and an
 * outage each keep a status of their own, so none is reported as a record that
 * is not there.
 *
 * Nothing the engine said reaches the response, with one exception: a 403
 * whose sentence names the role it wanted, which is written for the operator
 * and tells them who could open the page.
