/**
 * Keeps a console session alive past the engine's session token.
 *
 * The engine signs a session token that lives a few minutes and answers a
 * refresh token beside it on a password or second-factor sign-in. Before a
 * request reaches a load or an action, a session token with under two minutes
 * left is traded for a new pair and both cookies are rewritten. SvelteKit
 * reads a cookie set during a request back from that request, so every load
 * and action after this step sends the new token.
 *
 * The engine rotates the refresh token on every trade and reads a second use
 * of a rotated one as theft: it revokes the whole family, which signs the
 * person out. A page sends several requests at once, and the browser can send
 * one with the old cookies before it has stored the new ones. So one trade
 * runs per refresh token in this process, and for ten seconds its answer goes
 * to any request that carries the same refresh token and the same session
 * cookie. A request that carries the old refresh token with any other session
 * cookie, or none, goes to the engine, so a copied refresh token still trips
 * the engine's check.
 *
 * A sign-in through a provider or an emailed link answers no refresh token,
 * so those sessions still end when their token does.
