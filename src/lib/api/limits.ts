/**
 * The two things a plugin tells a console beside a refusal's sentence.
 *
 * A refusal that shares its status with another on the same route carries a
 * stable `code`, such as `rate_limit.list_full` beside
 * `rate_limit.duplicate_entry`, both 409. A page branches on the code and
 * relays the sentence, so a reworded message never changes what it does.
 *
 * A read that is held to a ceiling carries `limits`, one entry per thing it
 * counts: `{"entries": {"limit": 500, "current": 12}}`. A null limit is no
 * ceiling. The console reads the numbers rather than holding either.
