/**
 * The request-capture plugin's admin routes.
 *
 * A capture is a request this instance served, kept with its response for a
 * while so it can be replayed and compared. Without a rule the plugin keeps
 * every request for its default day. A tenant with at least one enabled rule
 * keeps only what a rule matches, sampled at the rule's rate, for the rule's
 * retention. That inversion is the thing a reader misses: the first rule
 * narrows what is captured, it does not add to it.
 *
 * A replay set is a named list of captures replayed together, each answering
 * its own diff against the original. Whether this install may create a rule
 * or a set is the plugin's answer, `licensed` on its reads. Replaying a set
 * that exists is not gated by it.
