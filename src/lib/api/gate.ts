/**
 * What a page makes of a refused read, the same way for every page.
 *
 * A page never knows how its plugin is licensed, which role a route needs or
 * whether the database is up. It knows what the engine answered:
 *
 *   404  the route is not there: the plugin is not in this build, or does not
 *        serve it.
 *   402  the engine refused what this instance is not enabled for. A capacity
 *        refusal says `cap_exceeded` and carries the ceiling and the count, so
 *        a page never holds either number itself.
 *   403  the reader's role may not read it. Another role may.
 *   429  the engine refused for the request rate. It answered, so this is not
 *        an outage, and the same read succeeds once the window passes.
 *   503  the engine or its database did not answer. A 502 or a 504 is the
 *        same outage reported by a proxy in front of the engine, and so is a
 *        read that never reached the engine at all.
 *   else the read failed, and a failed read is never a report that there is
 *        nothing to show.
