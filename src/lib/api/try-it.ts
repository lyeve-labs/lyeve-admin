 * Running a documented endpoint from the page that documents it.

 * somebody opens an API reference at all, and the admin is in an unusual
 * position to offer it: the reader already holds a session against the very
 * engine being documented, so there is no key to make and nothing to set up.
 *
 * The whole design is in what it refuses. A try-it that fires a DELETE
 * performs a real delete against real tenant data, and the page it sits on
 * looks like documentation rather than like a console.
