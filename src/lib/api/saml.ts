/**
 * The SAML plugin's admin routes.
 *
 * A SAML deployment fails on a date, not on a change. The service provider
 * certificate this instance mints is good for a year and the identity
 * provider's is set by somebody else entirely. Both expire in silence, and the
 * first report is that nobody can sign in. So the list carries expiry dates
 * rather than certificates, and the screen's job is to say which one runs out
 * first and how long is left.
 *
 * Rollover is two steps and they are not interchangeable. Staging mints a
 * certificate into a second slot and publishes it in the SP metadata document
 * beside the active one. Promoting makes it the one every AuthnRequest is
 * signed with. Doing the second without the first means the IdP starts seeing
 * signatures from a key it has never been told to trust.
 *
 * A provider is addressed by name on the sign-in path and by id everywhere
 * else. Names are display names, so they hold spaces and have to be encoded
 * into a URL rather than concatenated into one.
