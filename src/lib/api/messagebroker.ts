/**
 * The messagebroker plugin's one admin route.
 *
 * The broker is configured by the deployment, not through the admin, so there
 * is nothing here to write. What there is to read matters more than usual:
 * publishing is fire and forget by design, because failing the hook would stop
 * the CMS accepting content whenever the broker is down. The cost of that
 * choice is that a broker can refuse every event for a week without anything
 * in the product saying so.
 *
 * Three outcomes are counted apart because they have different fixes.
 * Published is the broker accepting an event. Failed is the broker refusing
 * one, which is a broker problem. Dropped is this instance having nowhere to
 * send one, which is a configuration problem here. Where the plugin keeps an
 * outbox, a refused event is retried, so Failed counts attempts and the
 * outbox's dead count is the number of events lost.
