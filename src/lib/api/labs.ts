/**
 * The API labs: the executing half of the API reference.
 *
 * The reference page documents every endpoint and renders a curl line that is
 * explicitly a preview, not a client. A reader who wants to know what the API
 * actually answers has to leave the product, copy the line, find a token and
 * paste it into a terminal. The labs close that: pick a documented endpoint,
 * fill its parameters, send it, read the answer.
 *
 * Three protocols, because the instance speaks three and a tester has to be
 * able to reach each: REST over the admin and content routers, GraphQL at one
 * endpoint with a query and variables, and gRPC through the transcoded REST
 * paths its own listener serves.
 *
 * ## Why the request is built here and sent by the server
 *
 * The session is an HttpOnly `__Host-` cookie, so browser JavaScript cannot
 * attach it and must not be handed a token to attach instead. The send is a
 * form action, which already carries the caller's session, and the reply is
 * rendered from the action's result.
 *
 * ## Why a server that sends a request is dangerous, and what stops it
 *
 * A server-side sender that takes a URL is a request forgery primitive: the
 * caller names a host and the server, inside the network, fetches it. Nothing
 * here takes a host. A lab request names an endpoint **that the engine
 * documented**, and the path is rebuilt from that document by substituting
 * parameter values into its own template. An arbitrary path cannot be
 * expressed, so there is nothing to smuggle a host into.
 *
 * The caller's own session is used unchanged, so the engine's authorization
 * decides what the request may do. The labs add no capability: anything a
 * lab can send, its operator could already have sent with curl.
