/**
 * The alert channels every monitoring plugin offers, in the one shape they
 * all answer and accept: email recipients, a Slack and a Discord URL, a
 * signed HTTPS webhook and a PagerDuty routing key.
 *
 * The URLs and the routing key are credentials, so every answer masks them to
 * the host and the last four characters. A form shows the masked value as it
 * was read and sends it back unchanged, and the plugin reads a masked value as
 * "keep the one stored". Clearing a field removes that channel.
 *
 * Email works on every install. A plugin may refuse a new or changed chat,
 * webhook or PagerDuty channel with 402, and some plugins say beforehand
 * whether they would, through `licensed` on their own read.
