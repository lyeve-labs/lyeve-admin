/**
 * The idempotency plugin's admin routes.
 *
 * A key is one client-supplied request identifier and the response that was
 * stored against it. A replay is a second request carrying the same key: the
 * stored response is returned and the handler never runs, which is the point.
 *
 * The number worth reading is in-flight. A key is recorded before the handler
 * finishes and completed afterwards, so an in-flight key is either a request
 * happening right now or one whose process died mid-handler. The second kind
 * blocks every retry of that key until it expires, and nothing else in the
 * product reports it.
