/**
 * What a page may ask of the app shell around it.
 *
 * The layout mounts AppShell and a page never sees it, so a page that wants
 * the frame out of its way needs a channel up, because the layout reads its
 * own load and nothing else. This is context rather than
 * a module-level `$state`, because a module is one object for every request
 * the server renders and a page's ask would leak into the next reader's
 * frame. Context is scoped to the tree the layout mounts. It is not a store,
 * which the admin does not use.
