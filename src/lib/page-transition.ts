 * Fades the new page in on a route change. Pass it to SvelteKit's onNavigate.
 *
 * SvelteKit calls it just before it swaps the page in, in the same task, so
 * the marked element is still transparent at the first frame that shows the
 * new page. Inside the console's frame only the content region fades, and the
 * sidebar and the header hold still. A change that enters or leaves the frame
 * fades the whole body.
 *
 * Nothing asks the browser for a view transition. In desktop Chrome on Intel
 * graphics a view transition's snapshot came out white: the content region
 * flashed white while it had a snapshot of its own, and the whole page did
 * once only the root had one.
 *
 * A change of query alone, such as a filter or a page of results, keeps the
 * reader in place and does not fade. Under reduced motion the kit's
 * stylesheet shortens the fade to 1ms.
