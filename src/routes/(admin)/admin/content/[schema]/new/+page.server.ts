 * Create the entry in the store the rest of the section reads.

 * Content has two stores. The admin store (sys_content_entries) is what every
 * other page in this section talks to: the listing, the editor, publish,
 * rollback, revisions, translations, relationships and delete. The v1 routes
 * read the schema engine's per-schema tables, which nothing in the admin
 * writes to or reads from.
 *
 * So this action writes to the admin store. An entry created through the v1
 * route lands in a store the admin never looks at: the listing would say "No
 * entries yet" over it, and it could not be opened, edited, published or
 * deleted from the admin at all. The relations write below carries the new
 * id, so it has to name the same store.
