	 * entitlements, which decide the license's answers, and the plugin status,
	 * which says why a plugin does not run, so a page reached by its URL can
	 * say so. The engine refuses both to every other role, so nobody else is
	 * asked for them, and their entitlements read as no features, as a failed
	 * read does.
	 *
	 * The running list is the status report's serving plugins less what the
	 * entitlements withhold from this tenant. An operator who read both has
	 * that answer already and reads the list only when either read failed.
	 * Everybody else reads the list.
	 *
	 * The second round asks only the parts that are there. The migration count
	 * is the schema plugin's and the tenant's frame is the multitenant
	 * plugin's, so an engine without them is not asked for either. The links
	 * and the renewal belong to the license module, and the entitlements say
	 * whether the build links one.
	 *
	 * The load reads no url and no params, so SvelteKit keeps the shell's data
	 * across a client-side navigation and asks the engine again on a fresh
	 * document or after a write invalidates. A page load that awaits parent()
	 * runs all of it again on the server, so a page that wants only the account
	 * reads it with loadUser, which asks once per request.
