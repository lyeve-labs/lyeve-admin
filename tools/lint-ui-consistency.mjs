/**
 * Fail when a page reinvents something the kit already provides.
 *
 *   node tools/lint-ui-consistency.mjs [--json]
 *
 * With nothing written down about what a page looks like, every page grows
 * its own title size, its own container width, its own empty state and its
 * own idea of a button, and the only way to notice is to open two pages side
 * by side. That check has to be repeated after every change, and it finds the
 * same classes of defect every time: a hand-rolled control the kit already
 * ships, a stock palette color that ignores the theme, a character standing
 * in for an icon, one control nested inside another.
 *
 * So the rules below are not invented here. They are what the kit already
 * offers, written down so a page that walks away from it fails instead of
 * merely looking slightly different. Each rule states the defect it guards
 * against, because a rule whose reason is lost is a rule the next person
 * deletes.
 *
 * A rule can also be narrower than the defect class it is named for, and then
 * it reports a confident zero forever. So each rule reads every spelling of
 * its defect it can name, not only the first one.
